      <p>You deserve a circle of inclusion and influence, but it is up to you to create it.</p>
      <br> <p> These conversations confirmed what these activists had always suspected: LGBTIQ+ People could not access legal redress, and there were no systems even to pursue legal redress. Armed with their knowledge and feedback from the community, a group of six activists sat down and wrote a proposal that was the first step to officially establishing The Commission.</p>

    The National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) is an independent human rights institution working for legal and policy reforms towards equality and full inclusion of sexual and gender minorities in Kenya.

    The Commission was borne out of conversations.
